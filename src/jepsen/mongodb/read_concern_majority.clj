  "Read Concern Majority Test.

  OVERVIEW:

  readConcern majority should provide the guarantee that any data returned is
  the result of committed operations, i.e. operations that are present on a
  majority of the nodes in the replica set, and therefore should never be rolled
  back. To check this, we verify the following property, which should hold given
  the restriction that we consider only document insert operations; no updates
  or deletes.

  If R is a readConcern majority read that occurs at time T (from the
  perspective of a fixed client) and reads the set of documents D from a
  collection C, then any read R' that occurs at time T’ >= T, should read a set
  of  documents D' such that D is a subset of D', i.e. every document that
  exists in D should exist in D'.


  TEST SETUP:

  In order to check the above property, this test continually inserts unique
  documents, on potentially many writer threads, while a single thread
  periodically reads the full state of the collection. When the test completes,
  we verify that the set of documents returned by every read R is a subset of
  the documents returned by the subsequent read, R'. Note that 'subsequent' in
  this context has a well defined meaning since reads occur within a single
  thread of execution.

  e.g.

    Reader/Writer Threads:

    * = insert operation
    R = read operation
